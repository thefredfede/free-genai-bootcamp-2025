**Business Considerations**
**Use Cases:**
Using a RAG-based document retrieval assistant for Enterprise Knowledge Management.
We want to assist the call center agents in responding to RFI or inquiries either based on conversational analytics or keyword searches.
For example, using Amazon Q to parse information from S3 or other repositories, using Amazon Comprehend and Contact Lens to analyse conversations, pass intents to Amazon Q, and Amazon Q presenting information to the agent in realtime, thus improving the call center experience. Then utilizing Amazon Bedrock to generate curated responses and summaries for interactions & governance.

**Complexity:** 
The number of "moving parts" depends on:
  - Architecture Choice (e.g., API-based, fine-tuned models, RAG-enhanced systems)
  - Operational Complexity (e.g., self-hosted models require more maintenance)
  - Security & Compliance Needs (e.g., AI governance, data privacy, PII redaction, adversarial robustness, bias audits)	| High complexity
  - Data Preparation & Ingestion	Collects (cleans, and transforms data for training & fine-tuning)	| Moderate complexity (If structured) | High complexity (If unstructured)
  - LLM Model Selection	(Choose pre-trained, fine-tuned, or self-hosted models)	| Moderate complexity
  - Inference & Deployment Hosting (Cloud APIs, On-prem GPUs, Edge AI)	| Moderate complexity (API-based) | High complexity (Self-hosted)
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - (Enhances responses with external knowledge)	| High complexity
  - Prompt Engineering & Optimization	(Customizes AI behavior for business needs) | Moderate complexity
  - Observability & Monitorin - (Tracks model accuracy, performance, and hallucination rates)	| High complexity
  - Retraining & Updates - (Model drift detection, continuous fine-tuning)	| High complexity

LLMs are NOT "set and forget"â€”they require continuous monitoring, tuning, and governance.
A basic LLM API solution may only need minimal maintenance (Monitoring latency, security updates).
A self-hosted or fine-tuned model demands full-time AI engineers (Regular tuning, retraining, security audits).

Key levers of cost: As a stakeholder how can I understand the key costs to running GenAI at a glance?
  **Model Type**	- Pre-trained (API) vs. fine-tuned vs. custom model
  **Inference Costs**	(Cost per token, API calls, response latency) - Token limits, latency SLAs	
  **Compute & Hardware**	- on-prem vs. cloud vs. hybrid > Instance type (A100, H100, Inferentia)
  **Storage & Data Costs**	- Data retention policies, storage type (hot/cold)
  **Networking & Bandwidth**	- Data movement between cloud/on-prem	
  **Security & Compliance**	- PII masking, GDPR, AI bias monitoring	
  **MLOps & Monitoring**	- Drift detection, real-time monitoring	
  **Personnel & Expertise**	- Internal team vs. Managed AI services

**Understanding Where You Spend:**
**Fixed Costs (Upfront, One-Time)**
  - Model selection: Pre-trained API vs. Custom Fine-tuning
  - Infrastructure setup: Compute, Storage, Networking
  - Data labeling and preprocessing
**Variable Costs (Ongoing)**
  - Inference costs (e.g., OpenAI, Bedrock, Azure OpenAI API calls)
  - Compute runtime (e.g., GPU/TPU usage per hour)
  - Retraining models (frequency of updates)
  - Data storage and retrieval (cost per GB stored & retrieved)
  - MLOps & monitoring overhead (logging, drift detection)
**Hidden Costs**
  - Model drift requiring unexpected retraining
  - Latency-based optimizations for better performance
  - AI security (e.g., preventing adversarial attacks, compliance fines)

**Lock-in Risks:** 
The best technical path balances performance, cost, and flexibility while ensuring the ability to switch vendors if necessary.
  - Start with OpenAI/AWS Bedrock for fast PoC, but plan to transition to open-source (Mistral, LLaMA, or Falcon) for long-term cost control.
  - Use Dockerized AI models + Kubernetes so you can deploy models on any cloud provider or even on-prem. This allows switching between AWS, GCP, and Azure seamlessly.
  - Store embeddings in open-source vector DBs instead of cloud-specific options. Proprietary search solutions (AWS Kendra, Vertex AI Search) can lock in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.
  - Use LangChain, LlamaIndex to abstract LLM calls and enable easy model switching, because standard APIs ensure swappability between LLM providers.
  - Avoid cloud-native storage if long-term flexibility is needed to ensure data can be migrated between providers.
A vendor-agnostic approach using open standards:
  - Inference Engine: Self-hosted LLaMA 3 or Falcon (Optional: API fallback to OpenAI)
  - Storage: FAISS + MinIO (Instead of AWS Kendra + S3)
  - Compute: Kubernetes GPU cluster (Optional: Use cloud GPUs)
  - Observability: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus (Instead of AWS CloudWatch)
  - Security: OAuth2 + OIDC (Instead of AWS IAM)

What essential components should be conveyed as necessary when deploying a GenAI workload for production:

**Guardrails:**
  Prevent prompt injections & data leaks:	
    - Input validation & filtering
    - Secure API calls (Auth, OAuth2)
  Detect & mitigate AI model bias:
    - Fairness tests using SHAP, LIME
    - Bias filters on training data
  Hallucilantion prevention:
    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Confidence-based output validation
  Compliance & Privacy:
    - Data masking, encryption
    - Role-based access control (RBAC, IAM)
  Toxicity & Content filtering:
    - NLP toxicity classifiers
    - Blacklist/Whitelist content policies
  
**Evaluations:** evaluations ensure that models meet quality, accuracy, and fairness standards.
  Accuracy & precision:
    - Benchmarking with BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR scores
  Hallucination detection:
    - Confidence scoring for LLM outputs
    - Compare AI output to ground truth
  Bias & fairness:
    - SHAP, LIME explainability tools
    - Test against diverse datasets
  Latency & performance:
    - Measure tokens/sec, inference time
    - Load testing
  Security & Adversarial Testing	
    - Red teaming AI responses
    - API fuzz testing

**Sandboxing via Containers:** Sandboxing ensures that GenAI models can be tested, monitored, and updated in isolated environments before production rollout.
  Model sandboxing:
    - Dockerized LLM inference (e.g., Llama, Mistral, Falcon)
  API sandboxing:
    - Feature flagging (LaunchDarkly)
    - Canary deployments
  **Security Isolation:** Prevent malicious model inputs from affecting systems	
    - AWS Nitro Enclaves, GCP Confidential AI
  Data isolation:
    - Dedicated sandboxes for training & inference
  CI/CD pipelines for AI:
    - GitOps with ArgoCD, Terraform
